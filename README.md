# 3D-Printer-Electroplating

This project was designed to be a cheap and easy way to plate a 3D-printed part in a substantial amount of copper, also known as electroforming.
Although this has its slight issues, I found that this was the only successful way I had it developed. One of the worst issues would be the time it takes. My final plating took around 4 days to develop. I'm currently unsure how thick of a lay was developed because I haven't measured it but it was around 1-2mm.
